# kaspersky-threats
Übersicht widget displaying Kaspersky's real-time cyberthreat animation.
I initially created a custom page for my home Apache2 server and thought it would make a cool Übersicht widget. The script is available on Kaspersky's site free-of-charge for non-commercial use.
The widget's size is modified by editing the "data-width" & "data-height" tags in the render section.
Enjoy!
